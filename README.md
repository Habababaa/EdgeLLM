## Overview

Welcome to the **EdgeLLM** repository, which focuses on running LLMs (Large Language Models) at the edge, specifically on devices like Raspberry Pi. This project highlights the edge-computing nature and AI capabilities of running language models in resource-constrained environments.

## Repository Description

The **EdgeLLM** repository provides resources and tools for deploying LLMs on edge devices, enabling users to leverage the power of machine learning models in scenarios where cloud computing is not feasible. By utilizing the capabilities of devices like Raspberry Pi, this project opens up possibilities for real-time inference and edge AI applications.

### Key Features

- **Docker Integration**: Utilize Docker for easy deployment and isolation of LLM environments.
- **JupyterLab Support**: Collaborate and interact with LLMs using JupyterLab for a seamless development experience.
- **Raspberry Pi Compatibility**: Run LLMs on Raspberry Pi boards, expanding the reach of edge computing applications.
- **Post-Request Handling**: Manage interactions with LLMs through post requests for data processing.
- **Pydantic Integration**: Use Pydantic for data validation and modeling within the context of LLM applications.
